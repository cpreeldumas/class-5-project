# LL97 Housing Equity Map

This repository contains the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code behind the [LL97 Housing Equity Map](https://cpreeldumas.github.io/class-5-project/), an interactive web map of NYC census tracts with [Local Law 97](https://www.nyc.gov/site/sustainablebuildings/ll97/local-law-97.page)-covered multifamily housing buildings categorized into four quadrants by their level of rent burden and greenhouse gas emissions.

The map relies on data analysis of the EPA's latest [Energy and Water Data Disclosure for Local Law 84](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Energy-and-Water-Data-Disclosure-for-Local-Law-84-/7x5e-2fxh/about_data) and the 2022 5-Year American Community Survey. More details on the data and methods can will be hosted in the "Methods" page of the map, which is still under construction. 

# Map Home View

The map lets users zoom, pan, and explore the census tracts. When a user clicks on a tract, the tract is highlighted and a table with additional data is dispayed in the left-side pane. A future iteration of this map will display additional data in this table, with a more in-depth exploration of at-risk tracts.
